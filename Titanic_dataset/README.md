Problem Statement

The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers who were onboard the Titanic ship during its fateful voyage in 1912. 
The goal of this problem is to use the data provided to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a passenger would have 
survived or not, based on factors such as age, fare, passenger class, and gender. This problem is of interest as it represents a real-life scenario 
where decision-making based on limited information can have life-or-death consequences. The solution to this problem can be used to better understand 
the relationship between passenger characteristics and survival outcomes and to identify important features for improving survival rates in similar scenarios.
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” 
using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
